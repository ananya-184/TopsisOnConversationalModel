## Overview
This project aims to evaluate the performance of various language models in generating responses to predefined prompts. The models are evaluated based on BLEU and ROUGE scores, as well as response length. Additionally, TOPSIS analysis is performed to rank the models.<br />

## Project Structure
Evaluation Script: The main script (evaluate_models.py) contains the code for evaluating the language models using BLEU, ROUGE, and TOPSIS analysis.<br />

Results: The results of the evaluation are stored in CSV files (results.csv and topsis.csv).<br />

Graphs: Bar graphs comparing TOPSIS scores and individual metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and Response Length) are saved as PNG files.<br />

## Usage
1.*Install the required dependencies:*

```bash
  pip install torch transformers nltk rouge-score pandas matplotlib numpy
```

2.*Run the evaluation script:*

```bash
  python evaluate_models.py
```

This script evaluates language models, performs TOPSIS analysis, and generates comparison graphs.

3.*Review Results:*

The results of the evaluation are saved in results.csv and topsis.csv.<br />
Bar graphs comparing TOPSIS scores and individual metrics are saved as PNG files.<br />
